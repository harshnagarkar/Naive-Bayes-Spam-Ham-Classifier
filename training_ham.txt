faculty websites seem to have disappeared anybody know what is going on
our institution current obsession with student success as counted by graduation rates and dfw ratios only exacerbates the problem by putting significant pressure on faculty to pass more students whether they have acquired the necessary skills and knowledge or not this pressure causes the entire curve to shift towards a and in some cases the bell curve has entirely disappeared from some of our courses with almost everyone receiving an a

this is often the time of the semester when faculty receive emails from students asking for a grade bump ie  a student asks for a favor such as their grade of 894 percentage be rounded up to a 90 to get an a should you deny the request and stick to the point structure on your syllabus doing so can result in guilt inducing responses from students about losing scholarships being ineligible for sports or not getting into med school this decision is of course totally up to you but granting an unearned grade bump just because a student asked for it can widen equity gaps that is it rewards only the students with the audacity to ask you for the favor many students including first generation and under represented minorities may lack either the cultural awareness or the boldness to ask for a grade bump and thus they may end up with lower grades in the class simply because they accepted the grade they earned sticking to the point structure on your syllabus promotes consistency and fairness in grading among all types of students to be clear if a student has a concern about a calculation error in their grade it deserves a closer look there is a clear distinction however between asking for grade clarification and asking for a grade boost
