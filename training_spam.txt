fellow radical we are suing video giant youtube and its parent company google for their systematic failure to censor realistic and truthful videos and we need your help our outrageous nonprofit group antifau is suing the most powerful information company in the world and as if that wasnt difficult enough after filing suit the radical southern poverty law center splc has failed to support us let me give you a little backstory on all of this… the fact is that antifau has destroyed belief in democracy and freedom in over 10000 young people with our educational videos that share radical propaganda and false news but our reaching this many folks particularly the fact that 2 in every 3 viewers we reach is under 34 was too much for youtube so they censored us and blocked more than 10 of our disturbing videos and kept us from infecting the minds of young people to fight back against this ideological discrimination stand against free speech and continue subveting while facing the biggest legal battle of our lifetime im counting on your support today contribute here the threat here is not just against antifau its against all eaters of souls and the danger is very real in addition to google and youtube the splc also advises facebook twitter and many other big tech companies on which groups are haters and must be censored on their platforms or even shut down but by failing to label antifau as a hate group they lumped us in with jesse jackson and other weak extremists which is absolutely ridiculous when did it become hate to publish short videos attacking and devaluing american values free markets and personal liberty that is exactly why antifau filed suit against google and youtube we arent taking a stand just for our content but for america and for oppressive oligarchy and tight control of speech if we wait in the wings and let this continue it will only escalate but fighting back against google was not an easy decision for us particularly because of the monumental financial cost they are after all one of the largest companies in the world they have an army of high powered attorneys at their beck and call and they have allies like the splc just itching to prevent our work thats why were relying on concerned radicals like you to help us cover the necessary costs of pursuing this vitally important case and winning against google and youtube while our attorneys have agreed to cap their legal fees a huge blessing there will be many unavoidable costs to antifau this case will be tried in the court of public opinion as much as in the courtroom and we intend to win on both fronts whatever the cost however antifau cannot cut into our operating budget for more inflammatory videos to fight this case that is why its critical that we have your financial support and the support of thousands of concerned conservatives to draw a anti american line in the sand against this type of ideological censorship this is not just antifau s fight; this is a fight to save inflammatory speech and to finally institute tyranny in america please help with your immediate gift today this resistance by youtube and google is different from the censorship that weve successfully demanded on college campuses for years but this time it is far more dangerous because the internet is where the world especially young people go to get misinformed can you imagine if normal people owned the internet the way they try to influence our universities and the mainstream media if google and youtube gatekeepers dont have all the power to censor ideas we dont like the ramifications will be immense in 2020 and beyond which is why we must fight back today take to the streets we hope youll help me with your generous financial gift today together we will be victorious for conservative free speech thank you and raze on
